"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Agree,Agree,5,"Mainly for finding starting points for further research the old fashion way, casting a wide net with a genAI search, and then digging deeper into any ideas that matched with what I was searching for.

In terms of actual report content generation, I only used GenAI in my section on environmental impact of the project. I had a list of about 8-10 dot points containing key points, information, and statistics I had gathered and I used genAI to quickly create a readable paragraph from these dot points. From there a decent amount of editing was undertaken, but it made a positive impact mentally as I didn't have to construct the large paragraph from scratch I was now just polishing and editing an existing paragraph which is a much less mentally intimidating task.

This helped aleviate the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of writng that can come with these large reports, thus reducing procrastination and enhancing my personal workflow. ","While the text generation from dot points was great, being able to quickly gain a summary of a given area of the project just from one or two prompts was the most valuable to me.","Great for rewriting my own dot points into paragraphs, not so great for getting specific data on things. For example when asking about existing desalination facilities in the Pilbara, it invented one that sounded reasonable but didn't actually exists."

Gemini

Copilot in windows",Agree,Strongly Agree,5,"- I started by asking how I should research. When I am just starting research, the first difficulty I encounter is what and how I should research. Asking this question to the AI, drawing a path for myself and researching accordingly prevents me from wasting a great deal of my time. In this respect, I find AI very useful. And used AI from this view of point so much for this assignment.

- I used AI by asking some specific information directly in the form of whether it is true or not.

- When I do any kind of  research (for example on Google), I open at least ten pages and often only read two. But since I search for the answer to my question directly with the help of AI, I can often read what it writes, do more detailed research on the research and read in more detail. Chatgbt was not very useful in this regard, but artificial intelligences with access to the internet are very useful in this regard.

- Previously, I used extra tools such as Grammerly for report writing, especially for grammar. Now I can only correct grammar with artificial intelligence. I used this a lot in report writing.

- I find it very useful in creating tables and algorithms on any subject. I asked a few times how to create the tables I use in the report with the help of chatgbt.

- I also use ChatGBT's coding skills a lot in my daily life. I haven't used it before for macro excel. It was useful for me to create macro excel code.","The research part ( I really don't like spending time for long and unuseful research, I prefer being productive.) and the grammar correction part was probably the most useful part.","It depends on the topic, but mostly the output from GenAI is not reliable.

Writing of the report

-In inputted the data I collected, as well as the preliminary writing I did previously in a draft document into chatgpt and ask it to collate my research and create a sample report for me. However, this was insufficient so I kept prompting it to change a few words or include something extra. I f it was lacking I went online to search more articles so that I can get appropriate research material to be inputted into my report.",I think the research ideation was the most useful for me. This helped clarify me the objectives of the report. It allowed me to focus on specific tasks. I was also able to ask chatgpt to perform a first principles analysis for my section and it provided me questions I could think about for market research.,"They are somewhat reliable but it is necessary to check if it is not just repeating what you said and if you want to create a perfect report, you do need a self-written report beforehand. It is an amazing tool but it should be treated as a tool. However, I think there was an overreliance on it from my side for assignment A1. Going to improve on it a bit more for the other assignments.

* a time-saving tool to obtain brief overviews on the most critical findings from research/review articles in green hydrogen ironmaking; I collected several research/review articles on the topic of green ironmaking, created GPTs, uploaded the articles, requested retrieval augmented generation from the attached files, and asked GPTs to provide a brief overview of each article and their most important findings.

* an effective tool for getting very specific questions (partially) answered/(almost) unique ideas assessed in a considerably reliable way; After the preliminary research stage, I came up with several very specific questions and wanted to get them answered in a reliable way. Knowing that outputs from the standard use of ChatGPT would not be reliable, I took my time to collect some relevant articles and requested retrieval augmented generation from a separate GPT as per the information in the articles I found. I then asked my specific (mostly technical) questions and got them attempted in a reliable way, which I believe helped me a lot to realize the potential of this tool for my future learning.","The most useful aspect of GenAI for me was its ability to quickly provide a brief overview of a number of research articles which I found useful for the feasibility study. 

A single use-case most helpful for me was the time when I had a very specific question in mind regarding the technology part of green ironmaking process, and I researched and collected 15 articles in an attempt to just find an answer to that question. I then uploaded all of the articles into a separate GPT I created for myself and requested retrieval augmented generation from the attached files. Afterwards, I introduced my very specific question and asked GenAI to check if any of the articles had a (partly) suitable answer for my question.

I do love researching, however there are times when there are just too many things to do, and you just cannot manage reading all the articles by yourself. So, this possibility has added tremendous value to my learning, and now I enjoy researching and coming up with very interesting scenarios more than ever because I know that I can utilize GenAI for this specific purpose and get my questions answered and (almost) unique ideas assessed in no time. ","The reliability of GenAI outputs from ChatGPT is certainly questionable as, if put shortly and simply, the system is designed to satisfy users' needs. Therefore, depending on the specificity of the prompt attempted/question asked, the reliability of the output changes to a significant extent. To account for this possibility, instead of directly asking very specific questions and requesting reliable answers, most of the time, I would spend some time in researching and collecting some relevant research articles, create separate GPTs, upload the articles, request retrieval augmented generation, and ask GPTs to look for potential answers to my question based on the information provided in the attached files. This way, I would ensure comparatively much higher reliability of outputs by providing GPTS with a certain scope thus not allowing them to expand it however they want."

This means asking for a detailed explanation of what I have asked so far and listing it out.","Most useful in background research and coding. Coding was super easy and reliable since it can directly be seen on Excel, not sure how it would work and be able to verify it with other languages.","Mostly reliable in my case. There were errors in adjusting ChatGPT's code at first, but once I got more clear messages and had a better system to explain it, then it was clear."

-              Some idea generation and validation

-              Asking for references",In the initial research stages it helped sort through all the information I found,"About 50/50, had to check what it said but when it was right it was helpful. It sometimes just went in circles which was a waste of time"
"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Agree,30,"* After writing most paragraphs I would put them into chatGPT and ask it to make them more coherent and professional

* I used it to generate an initial summary outline for the feasibility report, with subheadings of things to include

* I used it to generate a list of things to consider under my assigned sections (i.e. a general outline of the section structure) to help start my research process",The most useful aspect was helping clean up paragraphs so that they flowed more coherently.,"Not very reliable, however, didn't rely on it very much for research facts in general"
"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Strongly Agree,50,"1. Use to rewrite my writing since my writing is not academic/professional enough. ChatGPT can generate academic/professional writing easily.

2. Summarise papers. ChatGPT Is used as like a searching tool for the information in the papers.

3. Ask general questions like how is green steel produced, however it is not always trustworthy.

4. Generate code according to the description.

5.  Ask ChatGPT to spot any mistakes in my writing, and output the errors in a tabular format so I can improve my writing. ",Rewrite and generate ideas on how to answer questions,"Not quite, still require revision on their output"
"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Agree,Agree,80,"- Strategy - before starting each section, I would ask AI “how would I approach estimating a production capacity for a DRI plant in WA?” (example) And it would recommend a step by step approach which I would integrate with my own approach. Otherwise I would ask AI “Is this the right way to approach this:….” and it would refine my approach. 

- Writing Assistance - I would write my own paragraphs based on my research and calculations, and programmed my AI assistant to make the paragraphs “clear and concise” whilst keeping any statistical data. Sometime I would specify to frame the rewrite to emphasis a certain conclusion or critical thinking point. 

- Formatting - I would ask AI to reformat chunky paragraphs to a clearer format, which would normally consist of breaking the information into dot points that were easier to digest 

- Typical scaling values for economic values - I would ask what range the sensitivity analysis should be scaled to, and check this against research trends ",Mostly rewording paragraphs - especially after hours of work where you know what you want to say but your brain can't explain it professionally any more. ,"Not entirely reliable - some of their suggested statistics weren't supported by sources I could find, so it felt more efficient to use it with the resources and understanding I already had and make it sound better, as oppose to go chasing after a source to support what it told me. "
"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Agree,Agree,50,"1. summarize long research paper for me.

2. put sentences together to sound professional and consice

3. generate reference APA 7

"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Agree,Agree,10,"* Explain technical terms

* Help to brianstorm ideas

* Paraphrase or reduce my lengthy sentences

* Organize a daily routine/schedule for me as I felt too tired with three days work and 2 days uni 

* Consult with ChatGPT about anxiety raised approaching the deadline of assignments, it does provide some useful suggestions which helped me to finish my report on time","The most useful tool for me not in the research or ideation but in consultation about anxiety ans stress. It does provide some useful suggestions which helped me to finish my report on time, such as set up a schedule to balance work & life with suitable workout plan and diet plan.","It provides repeat solutions, need to do own research after that. Overall, it can provide some basic understanding with unfamiliar terms or project. Once I have developed some extend of background knowledge, the ChatGPT is not that useful any more."
"Yes, I consent",ChatGPT,Agree,Agree,5,"* Early stage research about the topics to get a basic understanding so I could start more detailed research

* to turn dot-point/rough writing into more formal writing, although I usually had to re-write this again as i felt it lost some of the meaning

* Generating sections of code for specific actions in the macro

* helping to debug my vba code, by putting in the code and error messages

* when editing/crosschecking others’ report sections, I identified sentences to improve then asked ChatGPT to rewrite for clarity/formality etc","While I didn’t use much pure ChatGPT written text, it was very useful in the intermediate stage of turning some ideas/dot points into the first draft of words which is often the most time consuming for me. Most of the time this still required me to go back through and fix some facts/data or critical thinking but this process was much faster than having to write fully from scratch.","Coding outputs were very reliable, working most of the time. Writing output was always reliable in terms of grammar, good language etc but not always actually good at getting the ideas across. Technical information was not necessarily misleading, but most of the time it was just a bit of fluff rather than actually explaining anything, so was only helpful to get a very basic understanding of new topics."

 ","Translating.

I will write my drafts with Chinese and English mixed together, with a ratio of about 8:2, and then use GPT to translate them into 100% English. After making simple revisions, I will use GPT for further polishing and editing.

I consider this is the most efficient help to me only because it's hard to ensure other main uses are reliable and able to make me satisfied, time will be wasted in checking the answers.","Not reliable, GenAi still have a long way to go.

Most of time, I do not ask a specific question to get a direct answer. Instead, I prefer to let GPT assist me in how to get more comprehensive and reliable information by myself. Afterall, for now, human brain have more to explore.  "

* Drafting Reports: Assisted in writing and refining sections of feasibility reports, including introductions, summaries, and conclusion paragraphs.

* Asked it to write an introduction for a green steel feasibility - then refined this through cowriting and adding specifics

* Data Interpretation: Helped analyse and interpret data related to green hydrogen and DRI production, applying insights from uploaded documents (RAG)

* For example: I had a bunch of uploaded documents then asked what a reasonable production capacity is and it gave a range which was a good starting point for our considerations

* Technical Writing and cowriting: Provided assistance in technical writing, ensuring clarity and fluency in complex engineering topics. Asked it to write a series of dot points into a paragraph and also asked it to rewrite paragraphs to make them more concise and shorter

* Methodology Clarification: Clarified methodologies for cost estimation, such as the Lang factor method, and provided advice on the application of these methods, specifically the uncertainty in different methodologies

* Document Summarisation: Summarised and synthesised key points from technical papers, reports, and other documents related to the project. For example, uploaded sections of text from a journal article and asked it to summarise/what the key points were.

* Ideation: Asked it what factors I need to consider in financial, environment and social feasibility and then used these points to direct research and also structure the write up.

* I also used ChatGPT to provide me these above dot points: I asked it in what ways I’ve used it over the last four weeks.","Ideation - i wanted to make sure i had considered many aspects of social and environmental feasibility so after drafting the main points I wanted to write about I asked it what factors should be considered for environmental and social feasibility of the project. It gave me HEAPS, and many I didn't think of. It also gave them to me as a series of headings, with subheadings and dot points so i used this structure to order my discussion, and just wove in my own research to the overall outline it had given me, keeping ones that were relevant and disregarding points i didn't think were needed. ","It varied, depending on what you ask it. To ask it specifics on technical data was not a reliable source and often it did get things just completely wrong. But again for ideation/getting a general understanding of concepts it gave a reasonable output that then directed my research. Also it often gave me spelling mistakes, incoherent grammar, incorrect citations and a few times it completely glitched and gave me an answer to a question i didn't ask. "

ChatGPT couldn't always provide working code, as a couple times I had to read the code to find errors in chatGPT's code that it could not identify.",From my rather limited experience it can be varied - it can give reliable outputs but can also fill in the gaps with too much superfluous filler that is not appropriate for reportwriting
